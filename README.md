# ML-Pipeline
## What is a Machine Learning Pipeline?
More and more businesses are collecting data with an eye towards Machine Learning (ML). 
But while most ML algorithms can only interpret tidy datasets, real-world data is usually messy and unstructured. 
This repository will bring together steps that organizes and cleans raw data, transforms it into a machine-readable form, trains a model, and generates predictions â€” all on a continuous basis. 
Collectively, we refer to these steps as a *Machine Learning Pipeline*.
